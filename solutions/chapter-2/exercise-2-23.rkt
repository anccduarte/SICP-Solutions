;EXERCISE 2.23.
;---
;The procedure 'for-each' is similar to 'map'. It takes as arguments a procedure and a
;list of elements. However, rather than forming a list of the results, 'for-each' just
;applies the procedure to each of the elements in turn, from left to right. The values
;returned by applying the procedure to the elements are not used at all â€” 'for-each' is
;used with procedures that perform an action, such as printing. For example,
;---
;(for-each (lambda (x) (display x) (newline))
;          (list 57 321 88))
;57
;321
;88
;---
;The value returned by the call to 'for-each' (not illustrated above) can be something
;arbitrary, such as 'true'. Give an implementation of 'for-each'.

;'for-each'
;---
(define (for-each proc lst)
  (cond ((null? lst)
         (display ""))
        (else
         (proc (car lst))
         (for-each proc (cdr lst)))))

;test for procedure and list above
;---
(for-each (lambda (x) (display x) (newline))
          (list 57 321 88))
